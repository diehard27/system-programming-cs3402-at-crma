=What are regular expressions?=
A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings. Regular expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic expressions by using various operators to combine smaller expressions.

The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that match a single character. Most characters, including all letters and digits, are regular expressions that match themselves. Any metacharacter with special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a backslash.

=Operators=

||Operator||Effect||
||.||	Matches any single character.||
||?||	The preceding item is optional and will be matched, at most, once.||
||{{{*}}}||	The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.||
||+||	The preceding item will be matched one or more times.||
||{N}||	The preceding item is matched exactly N times.||
||{N,}||	The preceding item is matched N or more times.||
||{N,M}||	The preceding item is matched at least N times, but not more than M times.||
||-||	represents the range if it's not first or last in a list or the ending point of a range in a list.||
||^||	Matches the empty string at the beginning of a line; also represents the characters not in the range of a list.||
||$||	Matches the empty string at the end of a line.||
||\b||	Matches the empty string at the edge of a word.||
||\B||	Matches the empty string provided it's not at the edge of a word.||
||\<||	Match the empty string at the beginning of word.||
||\>||	Match the empty string at the end of word.||

Two regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting regular expression matches any string formed by concatenating two substrings that respectively match the concatenated subexpressions.

Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator "|"; the resulting regular expression matches any string matching either subexpression.

Repetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in turn takes precedence over alternation. A whole subexpression may be enclosed in parentheses to override these precedence rules
