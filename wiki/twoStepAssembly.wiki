Two steps to using Assembly in Linux (ubuntu 9.10) 
Most programmers shy away from assembly language. The reason is not that
they don't have a solid background of assembly but that they don't know
how to write code outside the simulators etc that they are familiar.
Especially when it comes using assembly under linux.

It comprises two steps.

1. Compiling with assembler The assembly language compiler in linux is
as. The code to compile a program say helloWorld.s is the following
{{{
$ as helloWorld.s -o helloWorld.o
}}}
2. Linking and Executing the code The output of assembling is object
code which needs linking. The code for linking the object file
"helloWorld.o".
{{{
$ ld -o helloWorld.out helloWorld.o 
}}}
To execute the code we need to do
the following. 
{{{
$ ./helloWorld.out
}}}

โปรแกรม hello.s
{{{
.text
                           .global _start _start:

        movl $len,%edx # third argument: message length
        movl $msg,%ecx # second argument: pointer to message to write
        movl $1,%ebx # first argument: file handle (stdout)
        movl $4,%eax # system call number (sys_write)
        int $0x80 # call kernel

# and exit

        movl $0,%ebx # first argument: exit code
        movl $1,%eax # system call number (sys_exit)
        int $0x80 # call kernel

.data # section declaration

msg:
        .ascii "Hello, world!\n" # our dear string
        len = . - msg # length of our dear string
}}}
